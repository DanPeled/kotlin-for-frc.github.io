# IntelliJ IDEA
Rather than VS Code, when developing with kotlin the reccomended IDE is IntelliJ. IntelliJ offers much better autocomplete and syntax highlighting when using Kotlin and Java together (which we always are, as WPILib is Java)

You'll want to download the latest version of the "Community" edition, this is the free version. Installing this is pretty standard, but if you have any issues there are tons of resources online for it.

Once you've got IntelliJ set up, you can move on to the next section, which is about setting it up for FRC.
