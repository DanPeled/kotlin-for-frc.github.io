# Installing WPILib
Luckily the installation process for WPILib isn't changed much by the use of Kotlin in your projects, barring a few specific settings when installing that make your life easier.

To install WPILib you can follow the [guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html) contained on the WPILib wiki, with a few special instructions. Once you reach the page where it asks which install mode you'd like, make sure to select "Everything", and then on the next page select "Skip and don't use VS Code".
